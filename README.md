Scaleway utilities
==================
[http://www.scaleway.com/](Scaleway) has some neat, cheap servers.  I'm having fun trying to get NixOS on it (and learning about Nix in the process).

The nixos directory has my WIP installer and required files.

The tinc directory (will soon) have my configuration to set up tinc so that private-IP files can hit the Internet if you have a single box to proxy them.
